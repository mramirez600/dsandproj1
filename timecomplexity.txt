Task0 - I believe this is O(1) since we are only seeking the first and the last element of given lists. Regardless of list size, we only seek the first or last index.

Task1 - I believe this is O(n) since we need to loop through the given lists and the list that we create and append to.

Task2 - I believe this is O(n log(n)) since we are creating a dictionary and then need to sort it.

Task3 - I believe this is O(n log(n)) since we are creating a list and then we need to sort it.

Task4 - I believe this is O(n log(n)) since we are creating a list and then we need to sort it.
